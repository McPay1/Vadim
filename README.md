Balance between an out-of-date financial system and a new electronic commerce.
Invest in innovative technologies!
Invest in MCPay – innovative payment system with embedded function of traditional currencies and crypto-currencies conversion.
Its main tasks are: to immediately calculate currencies within different accounts of the same wallet, to remit any currency, including digital one, to other users’ wallets using the installed mobile application to make payments in any point of sale worldwide, where plastic cards are in a daily use. 

Unique character of MCPay program lays also in possibility to connect Visa/Maestro/MasterCard plastic card issued by any bank operating on the territory of your country to your electronic account. At that, you don’t need to open any additional accounts!

Our objective is to create a financial system convenient to everyone, which will drastically simplify mutual settlements and money remittances as such.

It is inherently a service specialized in financial transactions based on use of crypto-currencies rather than traditional currencies. To some extent, such project could be called a bank to define its purpose better, but institutions that have prior used this “name” brought disgrace upon themselves and so they are not synonymous with reliability and augmentation of funds. That is the reason why we don’t want our project to be consonant with them. 

MCPay will give to ordinary individuals and organizations everything they cannot obtain from banks: simplicity of cash transactions, financial confidentiality, opportunity for everyone to independently dispose of its own savings without necessity to be reportable to anyone and to pay its honest penny just because this is the way the things are done.

“Blockchain technology may take on a significant market share from such financial institutions as Visa”,
- Vitalik Buterin (Creator of Ethereum crypto-currency)
